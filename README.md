# Musical-Structure-App
Musical Structure App for Android Basics by Google Nanodegree Program

**The app’s structure is suitable for a music player app.**

**The app contains 5 activities.**

**App uses a custom adapter to populate the layout with views based on instances of the custom class.
Data about each song (or equivalent audio media such as podcast episode) should be stored in a custom class .
If images are included , they are stored as drawables.**

**Labelling**

Features in the app are clearly defined either by labelling or images. For example, a button to play music could use a universally recognized triangular "Play" symbol or could have the text label "Play".

**Buttons**

Each activity contains button(s) which link it to other activities a user should be able to reach from that activity. For instance, a ‘Library’ activity might contain a button to move to the ‘Now Playing’ activity.
